# odin-recipes

## Description of Project:
A simple website listing a bunch of recipes.
This website does not include CSS or other 
design. It only includes text. Which in my opinion is fine, because: a) I lack design talent, and b) I believe all websites should be brutalist. Just like in the good ol' days when I wasn't yet born (I was born in 1999--the doctcom bubble is history to me). 

An internet of pure text baby. GIVE ME THOSE TASTY UNSPACED BLOCKS OF TEXT.

## Skills to be demonstrated:
Basic HTML and CSS. For the umpteenth time.

I've been using HTML/CSS since I was in middle
school. Having never been serious about a career
in fullstack development until now, I feel the
need to "cross my t-s and dot my i-s" by putting
up more projects on github to showcase my skills.

Also, on a complete side note, I realize that most
spellings of the phrase used above utilize apostrophes.
I.e., 'cross my t's and dot my i's.' This is bull because an apostrophe followed by an 's' in English
indicates a possessive. Here, the implication is plurality. A hyphen, while strange, prevents confusion with the posessive convention of the apostrophe. Just in case someone is reading this. 

I promise I'm fun at parties.

## Self Reflection
This project taught me nothing new, but I did refresh my HTML for the umpteenth time to the umpteenth power. So I brushed up on my skills and got stronger in basic website building without styles. 

I also sat through the arduous process of designing content for the web, which reminded me of how important content creators are in making us engineers money and keeping the web economy going strong.
